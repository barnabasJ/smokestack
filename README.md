Smokestack provides a way to define test factories for your [Ash Resources](https://ash-hq.org/docs/module/ash/latest/ash-resource) using a convenient DSL:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Factory do
  use Smokestack

  factory Character do
    attribute :name, &Faker.StarWars.character/0
    attribute :affiliation, choose(["Galactic Empire", "Rebel Alliance"])
  end

  factory Character, :trek do
    attribute :name, choose(["J.L. Pipes", "Severn", "Slickback"])
    attribute :affiliation, choose(["Entrepreneur", "Voyager"])
  end
end

defmodule MyApp.CharacterTest do
  use MyApp.DataCase
  use MyApp.Factory

  test "it can build a character" do
    assert character = MyApp.Factory.build!(Character)
  end
end
```

## Installation

Smokestack is not yet ready to be published to [Hex](https://hex.pm) so in the
mean time if you want to try it you need to add a git-based dependency:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:smokestack, git: "https://code.harton.nz/cinder/cinder", tag: "v0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Since the package hasn't been published, there are no docs available on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm/), but you can access the latest version [here](https://docs.harton.nz/james/smokestack).
